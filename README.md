# BU_R_and_Git
Brandeis R coding club; repository to introduce git/Github

So I've made this respository to give everyone a chance to try out installing and
collaborating using Github. Though I made this in R, this principles are the same for
any text-based collaboration and/or version control project. 

First thing, make sure you have git installed on your computer, and that you've registered for
a Github account. I'd recommend using Jenny Bryan's tutorial as a starting point:

http://happygitwithr.com

I standardly use the "New Project Github First" 

http://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html

It's a bit easy to get lost making changes from local to Github so I always start by cloning an
already created, empty (except for README.md) Github repo.

To start, this document is in Markdown format, which means you can add code, which can (or not) be evaluated in-line.

For example:

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
curve(sin, -2*pi, 2*pi)
```
